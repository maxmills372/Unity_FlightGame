# Project Zephyr / Flying Game

This game is currently being developed by a group of 4th year students, but still in early development. 
This will be updated as soon as we have time :)

The idea is a 3rd person flight game, fighting in 3D bullet hell style combat in a post apocalyptic world against giant 
recreations of Earths culture.

## Think Iron Man meets Nier: Automata
